## Introducing GraphOwls

  <p>
      Welcome to the GraphOwls project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources so you can focus
      on discovering, interacting, and visualizing what's important to you

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://graphowls.com">graphowls.com</a>?

Not much, yet.

But here's the concept:

An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*

OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information ‚Äî We are living in the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with [(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion) and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data. We are surrounded by information and nearly none of it is useful.

We've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want to put all of that information at your fingertips. We want actionable intelligence quickly and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project. This is a free new community. A community for OSINT enthusiasts around the world and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.

<!-- ### Key Alpha Features

- Visual representation and layout modes for fetched data for easy understanding and editing.
- Simplified data fetching/transformations from custom sources using Python plugins, custom plugin/entity field layouts, check out the [graphowls](https://pypi.org/project/graphowls/) PyPi package for more details and expect many more input fields like files and checkboxes/toggles to come in the future.
- A development platform that is open for contributions.
- Works most of the time :) -->

### The future

At the core of this project lies a far more ambitious vision than the mere creation of an all-in-one data aggregation and analysis tool. What we aspire to start is the birth of a knowledge-driven community, passionately dedicated to the development of an evolving intelligence tool - a system and platform designed for discovering, interacting, and visualizing information to derive actionable insights. We imagine a system that not only learns from and evolves with your skills but also augments them. Here are some of our ideas for the future in no particular order:

#### Intuitive search and discovery tools

- We want you to be able to interact with our algorithms, filter, segment, search for particular data, apply advanced query filters, data layouts, build queries visually, and more so you can uncover insights that matter via an easy-to-navigate web-based interface.

#### Collective intelligence through collaborative workspaces

- We want to create a platform that promotes collective intelligence. Think of the currently popular collaborative workspaces such as [AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE), Logseq, or Obsidian but built into our data workspace. A system where each individual user contributes to the pool of knowledge, where you can share your graph environments, where you can track changes with annotations and comments, where insights from your workspaces can be optionally published and engaged with by a global community. Where every connection made, every data source integrated, every plugin created and shared by members of our community contributes to advancing insights around the world.

#### Real-time monitoring

- We want functionality that can provide real-time updates for a set of entities or scans, notifying you when theres new data, changes, and or emerging patterns in your field of interest. Automatically retrieve insights as time goes on and learn from history with snapshots of your past data.

#### History graphs

- We want to create a browser extension that allows you to seamlessly browse the web while also populating your GraphOwls graph. Each website you visit is mapped as an entity, with lines connecting them in the sequence you‚Äôve traveled. Not just a bookmark list or a history tab, the history graph could maintain the context, showing not just where you‚Äôve been, but also how and when you got there, and with the ability to extract a comment or piece of data out of a website you visit into an entity, you'll rarely have to leave your favorite web browser.

#### AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms

- Integrating AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms could let us create a tool that can continually evolve and optimize your operations over time. From NLP and sentiment analysis to search and anomaly detection with swarm intelligence, bringing data science tools and techniques to GraphOwls could let use create a powerful tool that reveals deep insights among a "haystack" of noisy information.

This is a project that will most likely not be finished for many years if ever, and that will require collaboration among experts in many fields. We're always looking for help, from writing documentation, researching feature ideas, designing the UX/UI, donating, to simply marketing and sharing the project, anything you contribute helps realize a vision for what could turn into a cross-disciplinary toolkit for working with information. Will you join me?

<!-- ## Getting Started

To start using GraphOwls, follow these simple installation steps:

*Note that if you're on windows and want this project to work you need unix line endings [(context)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13154031). Before cloning, run: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`*

*Note that if you're running on an **Apple** device you will need to open your Docker app, select the **features in development** tab on the left hand side of the docker app, and enable/checkmark the `Use Rosetta for x86/64 emulation on Apple Silicon` option if you want this application to work* -->

### Installation

install instruction will be here eventually
